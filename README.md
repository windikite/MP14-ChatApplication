My 14th mini project! In this it reaches its final form, taking on new functionality for a more modern age.  

The main features added over the last incarnation is the ability to delete or edit your messages. A lot has been cleaned up to make that possible. Messages now have usernames and userIds assigned to them so that they can be individually edited and deleted. However, you can only edit or delete your own messages. Along with that, messages now display the userName and timestamp next to them. 

I also updated the looks of the site, keeping a darker aesthetic with some retro elements. In particular I made the chat window into an old computer, complete with black background and colored text. 

This application must be used with the following websocket server:

Run both it and this react application, and then log in. You will be able to use all functionality within the Chat Room page.
